# OpenTelemetry Browser POC: Findings and Recommendation

*27 October 2026. OpenTelemetry JS SDK 2.12, experimental packages 0.219.*

## 1. Summary
A working POC adds OpenTelemetry tracing to a browser app and a Node backend. Telemetry flows through an OpenTelemetry
Collector into Jaeger, and one trace spans the browser click, the HTTP call and the backend work.
**Recommendation: proceed to a pilot on one real application**, under the conditions in section 5, because upstream
labels browser support as experimental.

## 2. What was built
```
Browser (browser-poc) --OTLP/HTTP--> Collector --> Jaeger UI
    |
    +-- fetch with traceparent --> Backend (backend-poc) --OTLP/HTTP--> Collector
```
Browser auto-instrumentation (page load, clicks, fetch, XHR), manual spans, a Node backend that continues the browser
trace, sampling, URL/exception redaction, session IDs, global error capture, Core Web Vitals, and an automatic
Markdown report generated from Jaeger.

## 3. Verified in a real browser (Edge on Windows)
| Capability | Result |
|---|---|
| documentLoad, click, fetch and XHR spans | Works |
| Nested custom spans (after the async/await workaround) | Works |
| Handled and unhandled errors; no stack trace exported | Works |
| session.id on every span | Works |
| Core Web Vitals spans (web-vital.LCP seen) | Works |
| One trace across browser and backend (click, HTTP GET, backend GET, db.query.simulated) | Works |
| Automatic report generator | Tested against a simulated Jaeger API; run it on your live Jaeger to confirm |

## 4. Findings and issues
1. **Experimental browser support** upstream.
2. **Versions must be pinned as a set.** Latest-of-everything failed to install. Pinned: stable 2.12.0, experimental 0.219.0, API 1.9.1.
3. **Deprecation:** `sdk-trace-web` and `sdk-trace-base` are deprecated in favour of `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace` (3.x). Plan a migration.
4. **Native async/await loses context under zone.js.** Children created after an `await` became separate traces. Fix: capture the parent context before the first `await` and pass it explicitly.
5. **Security advisory** in `propagator-jaeger` (pulled by `sdk-node`); overridden to 2.12.0. The Jaeger propagator is unused.
6. **CORS is required end to end** (collector origin, and `traceparent`/`tracestate` headers on the backend).
7. **Bundle size:** about 45 kB gzipped (145 kB raw).

## 5. Risks and conditions for production
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| API changes | Pin versions, upgrade as a set, test upgrades in CI |
| Personal data in spans | Keep the redacting exporter; review all custom attributes; avoid user identifiers without consent |
| Volume and cost | Sample 5 to 20 percent; keep errors via collector tail sampling |
| Public collector endpoint | Authenticating gateway, rate and size limits, real origin allow-list, TLS |
| Data lost on tab close | Flush on page hide; consider `sendBeacon` |
| Ad blockers | Send via a first-party path proxied to the collector |
| Consent | Initialise tracing after consent where required |
| Page weight | Lazy-load tracing after first paint |

See `docs/PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.md` for the full list.

## 5b. Logs and metrics
Added afterwards; see `docs/LOGS-AND-METRICS.md`. Metrics are stable upstream, logs are still in development. Bundle grows to about 65 kB gzipped. Verified end to end in a real browser (metrics in Prometheus/Grafana, logs in Loki/Grafana). One gap: the one-click log-to-trace link in Grafana does not pass the trace id (workaround in `docs/LOGS-AND-METRICS.md`).

## 6. Next steps
1. Pilot on one real frontend and its main backend service (`docs/INTEGRATION.md`).
2. Deploy a gateway-fronted collector and connect the team's chosen backend (Jaeger is demo-only).
3. Set sampling, privacy and consent rules before wider rollout.
4. Review upstream browser support and the `sdk-trace` migration every quarter.
